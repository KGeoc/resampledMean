# resampledMean
Project goal is to read a file with numbers and, select 100 numbers at random. These 100 random numbers will then be displayed, along with an average for those 100 numbers.
Designed with an object oriented stylein mind, any amount of numbers are able to be read into the file. Lists can be generated using any amount of numbers rather than just 100. In addition the project can be repeated multiple times, allowing multiple new lists to be created.
